<div>
    <p>
        hi, i'm <strong>joseph "joey" quismorio</strong>, and i am currently a 19-year-old sophomore computer science/engineering student
        <br/>at texas a&m university - college station. i was born on october 22, 2001 in pleasanton, california, and grew up
        <br/>around the northern california area (namely san ramon, danville, and dublin) before moving to san antonio, texas 
        at the age of 6.
        <br/><br/>
        i attended ronald reagan high school, where i played quiz bowl for their a team and qualified for the national
        <br/>championship 3 years in a row, participated in uil current events intermittently, and achieved some meritable things
        <br/>(nsmqt commended student, summa cum laude w/4.0 gpa, national honors society member). i eventually graduated in 2019.
        <br/><br/>
        my hobbies include graphic designing, making chill beats on my laptop, reading books and wikipedia articles, playing video games
        <br/>with my friends, listening to nice music, and writing screenplays and scripts that will never truly come to fruition.
